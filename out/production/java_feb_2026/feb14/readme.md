## Recap 

1. Data types 

int          whole number       4 bytes     
float                           4 bytes
boolean                         1 bit           true or false
long                            8 bytes
short                           2 bytes
char                            2 bytes 
double                          8 bytes          


2. Variables 

x = 10;



3. Operators 
4. addition sub programs


bit byte ? 

bit : smallest unit of memory 
8 bits = 1 byte 
1024 bytes = 1 KB
1024 KB    = 1 MB 
1024 MB    = 1 GB
1024 GB    = 1 TB

1Gb per second

## Operators 

1. Arithmetic Operators 
+  - * /   
%  - remainder   5%2 = 1
++ increment    + 1 
-- decrement    - 1 
x++ =>    x = x + 1; 


2. Assignment Operator 

=  ->  

int x = 10;

+=     

a = a + b;  same as this a += b;

a = a - b; same as a -= b;


write a program to swap two values? 
x = 5 
y = 20

swap these values 
x = 20;
y = 5;


# Relational Operators  / Comparison Ops

<
>
<=
>=
==
!=


x < 5


Logical 
&&    - both the conditions are true
||    - either one of the condition is true
!     - negation or opposite 

&& 
T    T    = T
T    F    = F
F    T    = F
F    F    = F

Mike will go to walmart OR bring Milk 
1. Mike will go to walmart
2. He will bring milk 

|| 

T     T   = T
F     T   = T
T     F   = T
F     F   = F 


! 
yes means  NO
NO  means YES


## Decision Making statements 


if is sunny day , I will take sunglasses 

if statements 
if else 
if else ladder
nested if else 

if(condition ){

    // statement 
}
Given number x = 10
1. find if the number if even or odd
2. find if the given number if negative or positive
